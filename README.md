I learn alot about how to make a timer from [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42693662/multiple-stopwatch-in-jquery) stackoverflow answer.

to make the runClock function learn about gitInterval() [here](https://javascript.info/settimeout-setinterval) and [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval).


I end up with just timer!.

features:
-strat by click on play button or clicking the alarm itself and stop the same way.
-the user can enter the minutes from 1 to 90 and he can't enter any thing alse.
-he can put the minutes he enter by click reset button or press enter on the input field.


I thinking of doing analog one in the future  with a spining tomatom in the middle of the screen it will be more fun.
